The interaction paradigm between man and machine has been changing in the last years. Over the last decades, humans have been interacting with the computer through writing (command line) or graphical interfaces. Recently, emerges the interaction through natural language. How to enhance the communication between man and the system used on daily basis, by using natural language? The usage of Natural Language Processing, a field of study of Artificial Intelligence, which may involve Machine Learning or Deep Learning techniques, allows the transformation of human language into a representation adapted to computation systems.

This thesis focuses on the design of a natural language module to integrate into the product named {\productname}, which enables consulting information regarding a manufacturing process. As result, a prototype has been developed, which consists of chatbot that is based on the conceptualized model in this work and that aims the understanding of natural language, as well as the extraction of information about the production state.
