The interaction paradigm between man and machine has been changing in the last years. Over the last decades, humans have been interacting with the computer through writing (command line) or graphical interfaces. Recently, emerges the interaction through natural language. How to enhance the communication between man and the system used on daily basis, by using natural language? The usage of Natural Language Processing, a field of study of Artificial Intelligence, which may involve Machine Learning or Deep Learning techniques, allows the transformation of human language into a representation adapted to computation systems.

This thesis focus on the design of an approach that allows to consult and present information stored in data warehouses, through usage of natural language. As result, a prototype has been developed by putting into practise the conceptualized approach. Thus, the main goal is to adapt and use the suggested approach in the development of a natural language module to interact with the {\productname}, thereby improving the system's usability.
