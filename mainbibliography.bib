@article{opportunities_of_sustainable_manufacturing_industry40,
    abstract = {The current globalization is faced by the challenge to meet the continuously growing worldwide demand for capital and consumer goods by simultaneously ensuring a sustainable evolvement of human existence in its social, environmental and economic dimensions. In order to cope with this challenge, industrial value creation must be geared towards sustainability. Currently, the industrial value creation in the early industrialized countries is shaped by the development towards the fourth stage of industrialization, the so-called Industry 4.0. This development provides immense opportunities for the realization of sustainable manufacturing. This paper will present a state of the art review of Industry 4.0 based on recent developments in research and practice. Subsequently, an overview of different opportunities for sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0 will be presented. A use case for the retrofitting of manufacturing equipment as a specific opportunity for sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0 will be exemplarily outlined.},

@article{modern_industrial_revolution_exit_failure_internal_control_systems,
    abstract = {ABSTRACT Since 1973 technological, political, regulatory, and economic forces have been changing the worldwide economy in a fashion comparable to the changes experienced during the nineteenth century Industrial Revolution. As in the nineteenth century, we are experiencing declining costs, increasing average (but decreasing marginal) productivity of labor, reduced growth rates of labor income, excess capacity, and the requirement for downsizing and exit. The last two decades indicate corporate internal control systems have failed to deal effectively with these changes, especially slow growth and the requirement for exit. The next several decades pose a major challenge for Western firms and political systems as these forces continue to work their way through the worldwide economy.},

@article{mes_literature_review,
    abstract = { Since their beginning in the mid 1990s, Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) have significantly evolved into more powerful and more integrated software applications as computing technologies have advanced. Their functionality coverage has changed significantly and can now provide a common and single system to support most of the manufacturing execution processes from the production order release to the delivery of finished goods. However, MES applications still fall short of adding capabilities for decision-making tools in very dynamic organisations where adaptive execution strategies are required to replenish the supply chain while dynamically responding to unpredicted change. This article intends to describe what MES have become, present their relationships with other enterprise information systems, and to identify major issues related to MES. We also discuss research areas that need to be explored in order to resolve the increased complexity of execution systems and to fulfil the continuing customer needs for faster real-time response and expanded functionality coverage. },

@article{intelligent_manufacturing_context_industry40_review,
    abstract = {Our next generation of industry—Industry 4.0—holds the promise of increased flexibility in manufacturing, along with mass customization, better quality, and improved productivity. It thus enables companies to cope with the challenges of producing increasingly individualized products with a short lead-time to market and higher quality. Intelligent manufacturing plays an important role in Industry 4.0. Typical resources are converted into intelligent objects so that they are able to sense, act, and behave within a smart environment. In order to fully understand intelligent manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0, this paper provides a comprehensive review of associated topics such as intelligent manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled manufacturing, and cloud manufacturing. Similarities and differences in these topics are highlighted based on our analysis. We also review key technologies such as the IoT, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), cloud computing, big data analytics (BDA), and information and communications technology (ICT) that are used to enable intelligent manufacturing. Next, we describe worldwide movements in intelligent manufacturing, including governmental strategic plans from different countries and strategic plans from major international companies in the European Union, United States, Japan, and China. Finally, we present current challenges and future research directions. The concepts discussed in this paper will spark new ideas in the effort to realize the much-anticipated Fourth Industrial Revolution.},
